# PodislandFrontEnd

Podisland was designed to allow users to explore podcasts, as I couldn't find many sites where it was possible to hunt down a good podcast.

The site includes a range of features:

-A sign up and login page
-Email notifications when you create or delete an account / place an order
-A Stripe checkout dialogue
-A shopping basket
