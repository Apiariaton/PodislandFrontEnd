# PodislandFrontEnd

The front-end for the Podisland project: this application allows the user to explore podcasts, login and create an account, as well as place orders.

In the future, I would like to integrate more features to the application, specifically:

A forum
Basic podcast data dashboard
A recommendation engine to recommend podcasts on the basis of previous users' likes
